	<ol style="line-height:200%">
	    <li>
            This is a Net implementation of Kontagent Client API, written in C#.</li>

        <li>
            This is totally self contained and does not rely on any other libraries. 
It has been tested in .Net 3.5. 	
	    <li>
            To use it, unzip the source code project. It is setup to build as a Class 
            Library. Build it using Visual Studio and add it as a reference in your app.</li>
            <li>
            API Usage:
                <ul>
                    <li>Init the KontagentRequestInstance in your your Global.asax 
                        Application_BeginRequest, by calling KontagentRequestInstance.Init. Pass it the 
                        Kontagent API and Secret keys.</li>
                    <li>If you use a Master Page for all your pages, place a call to 
                        KontagentRequestInstance.OnPageLoad in your Master Page&#39;s Page_Load event. Else 
                        place it each of your Page&#39;s Page_Load events that you want to track.</li>
                    <li>All URL&#39;s that you use for Invites, Feed Forms, etc. must be modified with 
                        Kontagent tracking parameters. Use the KontagentRequestInstance.MungeXXX 
                        functions to do that.</li>
                    <li>After invites are sent, call the KontagentRequestInstance.InviteSent function to 
                        track recipients.</li>
                    <li>Call KontagentRequestInstance.RecordUserInfo to pass user&#39;s demographic info to 
                        Kontagnet. To avoid calling it everytime, you can call it only once on install.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>To have requests sent over to Kontagent&#39;s Test Server, define KontagentTestMode 
                key in your web.config AppSettings and set its value to 1. Remember to remove 
                the key or set it to 0 to switch back to Live servers.</li>
